                <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript

                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
                    paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
                    all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p>

                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
                    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
                    client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. </p>

                <p>In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element
                    of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the
                    function. Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another
